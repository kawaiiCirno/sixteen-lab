    "    - Your video should include your color organ's response to [this video](https://youtu.be/dU80Fagdy28), which sweeps 20Hz to 20kHz.\n",
    "    - Also, demo and show off any special features of your color organ!\n",
    "- You may augment/improve your Color Organ using materials provided in lab.\n",
    "    - *If you would like to use materials not provided in lab*, you must first write an email proposal to the head lab TAs ([Kevin and Maggie](mailto:paynme0@berkeley.edu,berrypunny@berkeley.edu)) and copy your lab group member(s) detailing what extra components you would like to use, how they will be implemented, and where you plan to get them.\n",
