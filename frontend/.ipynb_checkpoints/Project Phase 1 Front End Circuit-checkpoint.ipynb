    "\n",
    "#### Setup:\n",
    "1. Start by making sure your micboard is powered by $5\\mathrm{V}$ from the voltage regulator at VDD and GROUNDED at VSS.\n",
    "2. Make sure OS1 is connected to the output of your voltage divider's buffer, and OS2 is connected to OS1 via a buffer.\n",

    "4. Display a peak-to-peak measurement for the current channel on the oscilloscope.\n",
    "    - Press \"Meas\", select \"$V_{p-p}$\", and press \"Add measurement\"\n",
    "5. Display an average measurement for the current channel on the oscilloscope.\n",
    "    - Press \"Meas\", select \"$V_{avg}$\", and press \"Add measurement\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now you are ready to tune your micboard!\n",

    "- This circuit will end up on your car on the ground, and you don't want to have your face on the ground to control it!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuning Overview\n",
    "1. Lower the gain: Turn the potentiometer on your mic board **clockwise**.\n",
    "2. Increase the gain: Turn the gain potentiometer on the mic board **counter-clockwise** until you see a signal with $\\approx2.5\\mathrm{V}_{pp}$ amplitude centered near $1.65\\mathrm{V}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully tuned your micboard. \n",

    " - Test by speaking (loudly) from ~2 feet from the mic board.\n",
