All you need to do now is to put everything together in a single Launchpad program. The objective is to get SIXT33N to move straight, turn left, go straight for a shorter distance, and turn right when it hears the corresponding command.\n",

Try reducing your SNIPPET_SIZE (window length) so your vectors aren't quite as long. This may change your classification, but hopefully for the better. It's ok if you get a warning about *low* memory."

    "That's it! You should be set. Now load the sketch into your Launchpad and make sure your Launchpad's 5V pin is connected to the voltage regulator output. If you forgot the pins you should attach to the motors and encoders, you can find them in the define statements in the top of the Launchpad sketch. If your car doesn't have as much drive as before, you might need to change to fresh batteries - check the voltage of your battery using the Digital Multimeter and if it is considerably less than 9V ask for fresh ones.\n",
